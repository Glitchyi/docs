Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. Users can create a database, set up column types, add records, link tables to one another, and collaborate with teammates in real-time.

Integrating Heyform with Airtable lets you automatically sync form submissions with the Airtable database. You can seamlessly organize incoming data and collaborate with your team instantly.
