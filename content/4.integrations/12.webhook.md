## How it works

Webhooks are a way to receive notifications when a **new form submission occurs**. With HeyForm, whenever someone submits a form, the response data is sent to your specified URL in **JSON** format through a **POST** request.

## Add a webhook

Publish your form and go to the **Connect** page. Click Connect to **Webhook**.

Youâ€™ll be prompted to configure your webhook endpoint.

## Endpoint URL

For the endpoint URL, set up an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint that can accept webhook requests with a POST method:

- Handles POST requests with a JSON payload
- Returns a successful status code (2XX) within 10 seconds
